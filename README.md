# Goal

- ask good questions
- key facts to explore a model/question
- planning and execution

## Questionnaire
- Provide an example of where the bear classification model might work poorly in production, due to structural or style differences in the training data.
- What are possible negative societal implications of text generation models?
- In situations where a model might make mistakes, and those mistakes could be harmful, what is a good alternative to automating a process?
- What kind of tabular data is deep learning particularly good at?
- What's a key downside of directly using a deep learning model for recommendation systems?
- What are the steps of the Drivetrain Approach?
- How do the steps of the Drivetrain Approach map to a recommendation system?
- Create an image recognition model using data you curate, and deploy it on the web.
- What is DataLoaders?
- What four things do we need to tell fastai to create DataLoaders?
- What does the splitter parameter to DataBlock do?
- How do we ensure a random split always gives the same validation set?
- What letters are often used to signify the independent and dependent variables?
- What's the difference between the crop, pad, and squish resize approaches? When might you choose one over the others?
- What is data augmentation? Why is it needed?
- What is the difference between item_tfms and batch_tfms?
- What is a confusion matrix?
- What does export save?
- What is it called when we use a model for getting predictions, instead of training?
- What are IPython widgets?
- When might you want to use CPU for deployment? When might GPU be better?
- What are the downsides of deploying your app to a server, instead of to a client (or edge) device such as a phone or PC?
- What are three examples of problems that could occur when rolling out a bear warning system in practice?
- What is "out-of-domain data"?
- What is "domain shift"?
- What are the three steps in the deployment process?


# Research
- Consider how the Drivetrain Approach maps to a project or problem you're interested in.
- When might it be best to avoid certain types of data augmentation?
- For a project you're interested in applying deep learning to, consider the thought experiment "What would happen if it went really, really well?"
- Start a blog, and write your first blog post. For instance, write about what you think deep learning might be useful for in a domain you're interested in.


# mlhub Challenge
- why Cross Entropy with binary outcome for each crop?
